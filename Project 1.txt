Project #1
Write a program which will:

Read the name of a file from the keyboard. 
Open the file. 
Read a 32-bit number from the file 
Display the number on one line as:
   a. A 32-bit binary number (32 bits must be printed -- i.e., include all the leading zeros)
   b. An 8-digit hexadecimal number  (all 8 digits must be printed -- include leading zeros)
   c. The 6-bit unsigned base-10 integer parsed from bits 21-16 of the number
   c. The 16-bit unsigned base-10 integer parsed from bits 15-0 of the number
Repeat from step 3 until the end-of-file has been reached 
Close the input file

A sample data file has been attached.  The values in the file were generated by a Java program, 
and thus are in big-Endian format.   Also, you can find Java programs for reading/writing 
binary files just below this, in the event you have not done that before.

The first two numbers in the file numbers.bin should produce the output

00000000000000100000000000000000     00020000      2       0 
00000000000110000000000000001101     0018000D     24      13     

Upload your source code to Blackboard.  I will test your program by compiling it and running it. 
Your program must be capable of being downloaded to a temporary directory and compiling
correctly using the command line:  gcc or g++ (ANSI standard C/C++) , python (version 2.7 only), 
or Java (version 8 or earlier) without assuming a particular directory for the source code or data.
(For example, if your Java IDE puts a package statement at the top of your source,
it's not going to work.  It may be good software engineering practice to do so, but I don't have
the same setup that you do, so it won't compile.)
